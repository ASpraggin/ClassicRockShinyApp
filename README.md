# ClassicRockShinyApp

The final project for computational statistics. A shiny app that helps to visualise the classic rock dataset.

To run:
```
install.packages('shiny')
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("ClassicRockShinyApp","ASpraggin",ref="main)
```

This app can be run online at http://aspraggin.shinyapps.io/ClassicRockShinyApp.

To interact with this app, drag the sliders to change the parameters shown by the graphs. The final tab is the dataset used for the graphs in this app.
